__Machine Architecture and Organization Projects__

__Project 1: Spell Check__
- implemented a program that stores dictionaries with binary search trees
- reads in data from files and creates dictionary
- users can look up words
- takes in operations via command line (look up, print, etc)
- given another file of words, it can check if those words are correctly spelled
- free memory and saves words to file @ end

__Project 2: Bitwise Operations and Puzzles__
- solved a variety of problems using only bitwise operations
- inputted correct command line args to solve bitwise puzzles

__Project 3: Bitwise Operations and Binary Bomb in x86-64 Assembly__
- solved similar problems from Project 2 using only x86-64 Assembly
- reverse engineered assembly code to solve puzzles by inputting correct command line args
